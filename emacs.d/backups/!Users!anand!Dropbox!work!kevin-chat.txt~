 me:  hey
 Kevin:  morning
i still work at fleshlight, re: your question the other day
trying to work on that, though haa
 me:  ah, got it
 Kevin:  now that we're settled back in the states and the kid has arrived
but in the meantime they are looking for contractors, remote work is ok
 me:  oh, i got it backwards
lol
 Kevin:  i figured that's what you thought 
 me:  heh; well it so happens i'm looking for work, still
 Sent at 7:57 AM on Thursday
 me:  so i'd be interested, if steve would be okay with me
 Sent at 7:59 AM on Thursday
 Kevin:  ok, i'll discuss
 me:  is david still there?
 Kevin:  they've actually been reaching out to former employees for these contracts
yeah
 me:  you know what they'll be paying?
 Kevin:  no, i can find out today
 me:  cool
need my phone#?
 Kevin:  that'll help
sure 
 me:  402.516.4502
thanks for checking into this for me; i appreciate it muchly
 Kevin:  sure thing
i'll see david in about an hour and see if i can get back to you this morning
 me:  great
 Kevin:  gotta go for now
later
 me:  ok
 Sent at 8:04 AM on Thursday
 Kevin:  David said that we would be interested in contracting out to you
When I asked what we would be willing to pay, he asked what you're looking for 
So, ball's in your cour
t
If you want to skip me and go straight to him - david@fleshlight.com
 me:  Great!
 Kevin:  Although I don't mind relaying info
 me:  If that's alright with you
  Kevin:  Either way
I don't mind
I'm hoping you'll be working with me
but he may have other plans
supposedly we're no longer supposed to do dev work and only outsource
according to steve
 me:  ah
 Kevin:  i'm not really happy about that
but what can you do
so i would rather work with someone i know
 me:  what will you be doing?
supervising?
 Kevin:  right now, i'm focusing on building a rest api
oh
i guess
and maintaining existing stuff
 me:  what frameworks are you guys using?
 Kevin:  we (the three devs here) aren't supposed to build, only maintain and work with contractors to build
Overall, we're still on the in-house PHP framework a former employee built after you left. It's not well-engineered at all. Some of the classes are over 10 years old, even - which is a really long time in PHP's evolution.
 me:  you using latest php?

 Kevin:  We in the process of switching all of our retail and dev sites to use Magento  which is based off of Zend
 me:  good to know
so david wants to know how much i want as the next step?
 Kevin:  we're using 5.2.17 on the old framework (that we call Cart of FleshCart)
yep
I wish we were on a more recent version but I'm holding off on requesting that right now
 me:  and i assume steve knows you and david are talking to me?
 Kevin:  no
he doesn't need to know
 me:  okay
 Kevin:  he'll find out but it's not important i think
he doesn't keep track of our contractors
which is one reason david talked him into moving that way
he got tired of hiring people only for them to be fired or stolen by another department
and yes, the next step is what your rate is
 me:  will this be for a specific piece of work, or sort of on-going if things are working out?
 Kevin:  my projects are a bit different from the main retail/distribution stuff
i'm not totally sure
I imagine the latter
 me:  good to know
 Kevin:  since we're supposed to be not so hands-on with building new projects
 me:  hard to believe you've been the 7 years
i've never been at a company that long
 Sent at 9:46 AM on Thursday
 Kevin:  My main personal project is the affiliate system. I'm moving it off the FleshCart framework onto to-be-determined. It definitely needs to have a greater separation of front-end and back-end. I'm currently working on a REST API for some aspects of it, so our Magento sites and future mobile apps can communicate with it.
Yeah I know, I looked at my linkedin profile the other day and it said 7 years X months and I was astounded at it myself.
 me:  yeah, REST API's are the way to go
 Kevin:  What I'm using for that is a simple REST-specific framework (so it's barebones) called Restler by Luracast. It's on github.
I need to figure out a future framework or other option for the backend of the affiliate system, as well as the frontend.
 me:  node.js is pretty cool
javascript though
 Kevin:  SO if you work with me that's the kind of thing we would be doing. Might be some opportunity there.
Yeah, I was considering nodejs
 me:  some fantastic frameworks for it
 Kevin:  Since it's a stats-heavy application it might actually make sense
 me:  everything still in mysql?
this is whole thing is a little weird as i was just looking at what i had done for fl and pp a few days ago
 Kevin:  heh
yeah it's still all in mysql, or some fork of it at least
migrating to a different db would be a pain since there's years of existing data
but if there's a performance improvement it could be justified
 me:  for sure, just thought some of your extra work might have gone to a NoSQL like mongodb
 Kevin:  I considered it at one point but there's been some restrictions because of sysadmin workload and focusing on using fleshcart
 me:  makes sense
 Kevin:  since fncash, the affiliate system, is going to be free of those restrictions eventually though, things aren't so limited if they make sense
and aren't a huge time-sink in development
that's the main thing, steve doesn't like work on things that he can't see results for
 me:  well the big change would be using node instead of php, bit of learning curve, but javascript is pretty good language and lots of companies are switching to it
 Kevin:  yeah
i've dabbled
 me:  but its the frameworks for node that really give you leverage
 Kevin:  anyway
 me:  let's say $40/hour
 Kevin:  ok
 me:  thanks again, Kevin
 Sent at 9:58 AM on Thursday
 Kevin:  sure thing
let's see what he says
gotta go to a meeting
 me:  okay, ttyl
 Kevin:  a crappy one
 me:  ah
 Kevin:  hehe
sort of drama-filled 
 me:  keep you head down!
 Sent at 10:00 AM on Thursday
 Kevin:  he said ok on the rate and you'll be working with me
 Sent at 10:08 AM on Thursday
 me:  wow, that is good news!
what's the next step?
 Sent at 10:17 AM on Thursday
 Kevin:  I'm not sure quite yet, I'll have to get back to you on specifics of getting you signed on.
So it might take a few days since we just moved into a new building
 me:  where's that?
 Kevin:  close to the airport
 me:  and where are you living now?
 Kevin:  we had been near 35 & ben white, in 2 different buildings. now we're in 1
brodie & william cannon
close to where i've always been in austin really 
 me:  ah
been meaning to ask you, have you been back to Pho?
 Kevin:  once we get you setup as a contractor, we'll get your access and then we should video conference or something to go over some things
oh yeah
a friend brought some to us on the second week of having the baby
 me:  so do you think this will be full-time?
 Kevin:  it could be, i need some more time to chat with david. the way our new building is setup there's a big meeting in the middle of the room where david and i sit, so it's hard to have a conversation right now
so i'll be talking to him later
 me:  okay, great
 Kevin:  http://www.fncash.com/?phpinfo=fleshin

 me:  i'll start getting my machine setup for php work
 Kevin:  k
and i'm using jquery with jqueryUI on that site also
jquery 1.9.1, not 1.2
 me:  i'm running 5.3.15, but i'm sure i can find 5.2.17
 Kevin:  i mean not 2.0
 me:  okay, got that already
 Kevin:  use jqueryui for the calendar widget, tabs, dialogs
a company is currently working on a responsive redesign for desktop/mobile
although, honestly it doesn't look that different
 me:  cool, i'm pretty familiar with jQuery already
 Kevin:  you might want to research magento a little since we'll be communicating with magento sites
 me:  of course
 Kevin:  i personally don't like magento but whatever 
 me:  you know, there are some sweet client-side js frameworks that could be used easily
 Kevin:  yep
 me:  have you seen angular.js?
 Kevin:  i'm aware of some of them, there are so many choices
yep
also, we're not married to jquery or jquery ui going forward
if something's not compatible with jquery or whatever
 me:  i've been looking to that stuff pretty heavily that last few months
 Kevin:  yeah i looked into angular
 me:  oh no, EVERYTHING is compatible with jquery, lol
 Kevin:  i know hhaha
 me:  angular is sweet because it has these binding that auto-fire events when the in browser model has changed
 Kevin:  yep
i actually tried to talk david into using that for his html5 warehouse app
 me:  it uses {{}} syntax
you can do any js expression in there
so basically, you ajax or php the stuff from the back-end into in-browser models, and it is real easy after that
i had been playing with backbone but started looking at marionette, chaplin and then ember and anguar
they are all good, but i got going with angular much faster and with a lot less code
and it wasn't expecting too, as I had a prejudice against it since it came from google, lol
i wasn't...
 Kevin:  hehe
speaking of google, i've been looking into dart a lot
 me:  cool
 Kevin:  it's actually pretty sweet
except for the fact that it's google
 me:  heh
i've been learning clojure and clojure-script
 Kevin:  but it's like javascirpt designed smartly

 me:  yea
