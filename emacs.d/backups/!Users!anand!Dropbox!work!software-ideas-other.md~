              console.log(index + ': ' + val);
            });

#### Previously

- sudo periodic daily weekly monthly
- use sudo opensnoop -vp PID #or without PID to everything
- learning by visualizing, pattern-recognition, using tools not-quite invented, e.g. Light Table
- Bret Victor‚Äôs site - <http://worrydream.com/>

#### Other App Ideas:

1. A Timer app like Timer with big pre-sets, but allow for MULTIPLE simultaneous timers
1. A Weather app that parses histoical data looking for trends
    - Temp, air pressure, winds: speed & direction, percipitation, dew-point
    - Mean w/std and variance
    - Mode
    - Median
1. Prioritizer: present a list of user-entered choices and use better-or-worse results from pairings
1. GUI for tree
1. Log pianobar music, markdown'd to file open in makred
1. change everwatch.rb to accept  watch file from the command line so that 2 notes can be watched

#### TOAD'Os

- @done key-chord for save in insert mode -- `ww`
- figure out indent problem in markdown mode -- disrespecting tab-width
    - what's up with node files not getting colored until buffer is reverted?
    - markdown mode will at least allow to double-tab to 4
    - consider modifying `tab-stop-list` for `M-i`

* * *

###### __The Dragon__ has *awoken*

#### Emacsy Things

- getting dates in any buffer <2013-05-06 Mon> 
    - use: `org-time-stamp` or `org-time-stamp-inactive`
- @done add underscore to pre blocks in css, via class?
    - better to integrate boxes as in *github.css*
- integrate markdown files such as this in org-mode
    - check out file links
```
    #+begin_src markdown
    #+end_src
```
- When inside the source block (between #+begin_src markdown and #+end_src) press `C-c '` to edit the source block with markdown-mode.

- `M-up|down` for changing levels
- `C-c C--|=` for changing levels
- ack from emacs please
- fasd -- cool cd and other stuff: <https://github.com/clvv/fasd>
    - found from: <https://github.com/revans/bash-it> via <http://dotfiles.github.io>
- wow, evernote-mode for emacs, avail as a package
    - <https://code.google.com/p/emacs-evernote-mode/>
- @done (setq scroll-preserve-screen-position 1) ;;always -- added to custom.el
- @done fix C-v in insert move -- shoudn't scroll down a page
- look at going back to always scroll-mode like in vim
    - using smooth-scrolling.el but maybe, works great if smooth-scroll-window is nearly eq to 1/2 screen lines; have mine at 13, which is about half of half-size window
    - smooth-scroll would be better?
- fix auto-save directory
- how are swank and slime related?
- reorganize `.emacs.d` files, using prelude or wiegley or magnars as a template (pick one and go with it)
- don't forget this if you want a larger font; custom.el is now 12 with 60x113 frame size; for 13pt, do this:
    - `(set-face-attribute (quote default) nil :font "DejaVu Sans Mono-13")`
    - `'(default-frame-alist (quote ((height . 52) (width . 110))))`
    - use customize-group default-frame-alist or modify custom.el directly

#### JavaScripty Things

- finish learning a js framework, (pick one and go with it)
    - organize this list by browser/server/both *(move it to org and use :tags)*
    - angular
    - ember
    - backbone
        - marionette
        - chaplin
    - meteor
    - zappa
    - zest.js http://zestjs.org/why-zest
    - yeoman -- WHY YEOMAN?

* for @kevin
    - Yii: <http://www.yiiframework.com/>
    - [vagrant]
* @done see about geting phpstorm to replace webstorm
* <https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php> php 5.2.17
* <http://coolestguyplanettech.com/downtown/install-and-configure-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-osx-108-mountain-lion>

* * *

* mysql install
```
==> /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.6.10/bin/mysql_install_db --verbose --user=anand --basedir=/usr/local/Cel
==> Caveats
A "/etc/my.cnf" from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built
server starting up correctly.

To connect:
    mysql -uroot

To have launchd start mysql at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load mysql now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
    mysql.server start
Change root password:
    /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'yourpasswordhere'
```
* php 5.2.17 install
```
==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/php52/5.2.17 --localstatedir=/usr/local/var --sysconfdir=/us
==> make
==> make install
==> Caveats
To enable PHP in Apache add the following to httpd.conf and restart Apache:
    LoadModule php5_module    /usr/local/opt/php52/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

The php.ini file can be found in:
    /usr/local/etc/php/5.2/php.ini

‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú© PEAR ‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©

If PEAR complains about permissions, 'fix' the default PEAR permissions and config:
    chmod -R ug+w /usr/local/Cellar/php52/5.2.17/lib/php
    pear config-set php_ini /usr/local/etc/php/5.2/php.ini

‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú© Extensions ‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©

If you are having issues with custom extension compiling, ensure that this php is
in your PATH:
    PATH="$(brew --prefix josegonzalez/php/php52)/bin:$PATH"

PHP52 Extensions will always be compiled against this PHP. Please install them
using --without-homebrew-php to enable compiling against system PHP.
==> Summary
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/php52/5.2.17: 444 files, 20M, built in 11.7 minutes
```

#### Vagrant [vagrant]

#### Done'ers, Those That are Done
