I am very excited to submit to you, my application for your recently advertised position of Project Manager.

You can skip the part where you look at my resume to see if I am qualified. I am more than qualified. My previous experience as a co-founder of a very successful computer-based training company makes it so. When I believe in the company I work with, I am unstoppable. I believe Phenomblue could be such a place for me. The work you are doing is in a word, phenomenal.

So let's jump right to the part where you invite me over for a conversation, so we can see if there is a good fit. I have always believe that in evaluating new folks to bring on, it is the overlap of values, such as working hard and working smart, treating others with respect, being creative and of course, working because you enjoy the heck out of it!
