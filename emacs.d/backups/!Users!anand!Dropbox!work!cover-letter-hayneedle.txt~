I am very excited to submit to you, my application for your recently advertised position of Project Manager.

You may skip the part where you look at my resume to see if I am qualified. I am more than qualified. My previous experience as a co-founder of a very successful computer-based training company and 30 years of industry experience makes it so. When I believe in the company I work with, I am unstoppable. I believe Phenomblue could be such a place for me. The work you are doing is, in a word, phenomenal.

Let's jump to the part where you invite me over for a conversation, so we can see if there is a good fit. I have always believed that in evaluating new folks to work with, it is the overlap of values that matters the most, such as: working hard and working smart, treating others with respect, being creative and of course, doing what needs to be done because you enjoy the heck out of it.

I am at your disposal.
